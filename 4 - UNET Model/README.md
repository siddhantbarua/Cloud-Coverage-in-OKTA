# Cloud-Coverage-in-OKTA
A UNET model for performing semantic segmentation on images of the sky, to detect cloud coverage in an area.

(This project can also be tried on Google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wl5gOlZiABUomLTcF-H9wKFymGTRAMZm#scrollTo=3mDG9YsrC2aC&forceEdit=true&sandboxMode=true)

his project trains a deep neural network to perform semantic segmentation on images of the sky. The output of the network is a binary segmentation map of the picture, classifying cloud and "non-cloud" pixels. The architecure used is the UNET model. 	

### UNET
UNET is a neural network architecture, first designed for use on biomedical images. It focus on image classification, where the input is an image and the output is a segmentation map of the image, into different classes. The original UNET paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf
The UNET architecture as shown below, has a contracting path, and an expanding path, giving it the appearence of a “U”.

### SWINySEG
For training the network, the SWINySEG (http://vintage.winklerbros.net/Publications/grsl2019.pdf) dataset was used. This dataset has 6768 day and night time images of sky/cloud patches and their corresponding binary segmentation maps. The zipped file of the SWINySEG dataset is included in the "Cloud-Coverage-in-OKTA/Datasets/" directory. The password for unzipping the same can be found at: http://vintage.winklerbros.net/swinyseg.html

### Usage
To use this program,
1. Download all the source files, by cloning this repository.
2. To train the network, unzip the SWINySEG dataset, the zip to which is given in the Cloud-Coverage-in-OKTA/Datasets/    directory. The password can be found at: http://vintage.winklerbros.net/swinyseg.html Then run the program **train.py**. The parameters for the network can be changed in the source code.
3. To use the model for predictions, place the cloud images in the Test/ directory, and run the **GetOkta.py** program.
